# PhunwareHW

I spent about 10 hours on the project. 

Areas of challenge:

1) Finding a good and effective way to do caching.
2) Formatting the time string to match the spec.
3) Setting up constraint layout to properly format based on various screen sizes and orientations.
4) Transitions causing elements to  “flash”. I researched some avenues to fix this, and tried a few to no avail.
5) Getting the card grid to act properly based on different screen sizes.
6) The debugger sometimes quit for no reason.
7) Managing various version of libraries.
8) Various little gotchas normal to Android app development.

I like working with retrofit and picasso. And there must be a better way to do transitions...
