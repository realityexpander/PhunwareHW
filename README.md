I spent about 10 hours on the project. 

Areas of challenge:

* Finding a good and effective way to do caching based on all conditions. Also, how long to keep cached data?
* Setting up constraint layout to properly format based on various screen sizes and orientations.
* Transitions causing elements to  “flash”. I researched some avenues to fix this, and tried a few to no avail.
   I'm sure its something minor that I've overlooked, there seems to be several ways to do transitions...
* Getting the card grid to act properly based on different screen sizes. Still not completely satisfied, I feel I
   could get it completely dialed-in given a bit more time and effort. The spec did not go into deep detail on this point.
* The debugger sometimes quits for no reason. Had to restart it many times.
* Managing various version of libraries.
* Really want to create a custom transition to keep the circular reveal effect, but it looks at first glance that would
  require several hours of work... maybe 2.0?
* Various little gotchas normal to Android app development.

I like working with retrofit and picasso. BUT there must be a better way to do transitions...
